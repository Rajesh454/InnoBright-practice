    <p>'Dhoniiiii finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd.
        India lift the World Cup after 28 years. The party's started in the 
        dressing room. And it’s an Indian captain, who’s been absolutely 
        magnificent, in the night of the final.’

      <h2 id="c1">Profile</h2>
        <p>Less than thirty years before that enchanting Saturday night when Ravi Shastri’s
            voice rang through television sets all over India, when even the spunky and exuberant 
            Indian youth showed more interest in an old-school CRT television at a local chai 
            ki dukaan than the dance-floor at a pub, a pump-operator in Ranchi awaited the birth 
            of his third child.</p>
      <h2 class="c2">Caiptaincy</h2>
            <p>'India may have gained a great captain, but they’ve lost a fearsome hitter’, remarked 
                Harsha Bhogle after Dhoni was handed the reigns of the side. It was true. MS Dhoni, 
                the powerful biffer of leather who could clear the area code with the willow, had now 
                become a gritty accumulator, who seemed to be playing a lot more responsibly. At first, 
                it did look like India had lost an important asset in Dhoni’s explosive batting. 
                However, over the years, Dhoni delivered performances with his new reserved approach 
                and developed the ability to move in and out of his rampage zone. He had inherited 
                the good qualities of his accomplished seniors in the team - carving his game as per 
                the requirement of the team.</p>
      <h2 class="c3">2019 !!</h2>
                <p> Dhoni goes into the 2019 World Cup after conceding the captaincy to Virat Kohli 
                    in late 2016, but continues to form the backbone of the batting line-up, not to 
                    mention, forming the cognitive core of the team's brains. The 2019 World Cup, 
                    perceived to be Dhoni's last, didn't really go according to plan although he 
                    endured a decent tournament. In the semifinal, he along with Ravindra Jadeja 
                    were the only men who showed fight but the finisher wasn't able to finish off 
                    the chase.</p>
